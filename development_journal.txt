CUURENT WORK:
- Implementing a parallel version of the 3/2-rule for FFTs.

TO DO:
- Update the serial heat equation code to do stochastic heat equation, and clean
it up.
- Parallelize the heat equation code and the QG code.
- Run the stochastic heat equation code on a varying number of processors with a
varying grid size. (Login to math servers?) Record performance statistics (grid 
size, number of processors, simulation time, etc.).
- Run the QG equation code on a varying number of processors with a varying grid
size (refining the resolution, not increasing the simulation space). Record
performance statistics (grid size, number of processors, simulation time, etc.)
and recreating plots from Di Qi's paper (time series of heat flux and 
statistical energy).
- Finish writing documentation for the code and write the paper to be submitted.

FUTURE WORK: 
- Utilize a COMMON block in the EZ_PARALLEL library to store commonly used values, e.g., the number of processors, the dimensions of the grid, the grid indices of the sub-grids.
